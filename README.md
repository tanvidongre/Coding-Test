# Coding-Test
1. Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat
   array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4].

2. Write a class TempTracker with these methods:
        • insert()—records a new temperature.
        • get_max()—returns the highest temp we've seen so far.
        • get_min()—returns the lowest temp we've seen so far.
        • get_mean()—returns the mean of all temps we've seen so far.
